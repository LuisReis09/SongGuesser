## Game: How to Play

**Note:** The APIs may sometimes fail in searching, finding, or verifying song lyrics.

### Inspiration

The game is inspired by a segment where participants are given a word and must quickly recall a song that contains it. Our goal is to create a fun environment that tests players’ musical knowledge and mental agility.

### Step-by-Step Guide

   Enter your name to be identified in the game. You can:
   - Join an existing room using the code and password provided by the host.
   - Create a room and set a password for it.

2. **Room Settings**  
   As the host, you can configure the room by setting:

4. **Starting the Game**  
   - Each round begins with a word prompt, and a timer starts.
   - Within 30 seconds, players must enter the artist and song name containing the word, then click "search."

5. **Song Selection**  
   After clicking "search," up to five song options will be displayed for each player, who should select their desired song and wait until time's out.

6. **Round Results**  
   - At the end of the round, a list of players' attempts is shown, indicating whether their choice was correct.
   - Each player can listen to a preview of the correct song and view additional information.

7. **Start of New Rounds**
