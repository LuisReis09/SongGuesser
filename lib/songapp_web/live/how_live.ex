      <p><b>Important!</b></p>
      <p>The APIs may fail in searching, finding or verifying the lyrics of the songs</p>

      <h1>Inspirations:</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The game is inspired by the Elle channel segment, in which participants are given a specific word and must quickly remember a song that contains that word in its lyrics. The game's dynamics are simple, but it requires a good musical repertoire and mental agility, as there is little time to think and respond.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The goal of our game is to create a fun environment, testing not only the musical knowledge but also the creativity of the players. Throughout the rounds, the tension increases as the words are revealed, and laughter arises with unexpected answers or desperate attempts to remember a song that fits. Our game is a fun way to test the participants' memory and musical knowledge, providing moments of relaxation among friends.</p>
      <br>
